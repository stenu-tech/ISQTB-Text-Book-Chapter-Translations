Testware is created as output work products from the test activities described in section 1.4.1. There is a significant variation in how differenet organization produce, shape, name, organize and manage their work products. Proper configuration management ensures consistency and integrity of work products. The following list of work products is not exhaustive.

Test planning work products include> test plan, test scheule, risk register, and entry and exit criteria. Risk register is a list of risks together with risk likelihood, risk impact and information about risk mitigation. Test schedule, risk register and entry and exit criteria are often a part of the test plan.

Test monitoring and control work products include> test progress reports, documentation of control directives and risk information.
Test analysis work products include: (prioritized) test cases, test charters, coverage items, test data requirements and test environment requirements.
Test implementation work products include: test procedures, automated test scripts, test suits, test datam test execution schedule and test environment elements. Examples of test environment elements include: stubs, drivers, simulators, and service virtualizations.
Test execution work products include: test logs, and defect reports.
Test completion work products include: test completion report, action items for improvement of subsequent projects or iterations, documented lessons learned and change requests.

1.4.4 Traceability between the test basis and testware

In order to implement effective test monitoring and control, it is important to establish and maintain traceability throughout the test process between the test basis elements, testware associated with these elements (e.g. test conditions, risks, test cases), test results and detected defects.
