A practice coming from extreme programming called the whole team approach.

Any team member with the necessary knowledge and skills can perform any task and everyone is responsible for quality.

The whole team approach improves team dynamics, enhances communication and interaction.
This allows various skill sets withing the team to be leveraged for the benefit of the project.

Testers collaborate with other team members to ensure that the desired quality levels are achieved.
This includes Business representatives to create suitable acceptance tests and working with developers to agree on the test strategy.

Testers can thus transfer testing knowledge to other team members and influence the development of the product.

The whole team approach may not always be appropriate. In some situations, such as safety-critical a high level of test independence may be needed.
